# Hotel Management Project

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project was to practice working on a project for college studies. To do this, I planned the programing process using a flow chart and made a client requirement table and a task table. I then used the programming stage of the project to develop my understanding of functions, arrays and csv files, but also just deepening my experience and understanding of Python. 

## Overview of the task

### Scenario

I have been hired by the Artemis Hotel to create a hotel management system. The system will be used by the hotel for managing customers booking and their details. The program system must be capable of providing the following information; hotel booking, provide you with hotel rooms info, room service, billing and record-keeping.

### Methods

The methods I am expected to use during the planning and programming process include:
- Analysing the detailed requirements using suitable methods
- Elements and function tables
- Algorithms/psuedocode or flow diagram (I have chosen to create a flow diagram to show the plan for my program)
- Showing the iterative development of the individual solutions with suitable testing throughout the process
- Testing the final product with an appropriate test table and evaluating the solution against the detailed requirements

### System requirements 

The requirements for the system are:
- Main menu options
- Personal details, including the type of room and service booked
- Hotel room details, including the type of room, number of people, number of beds, what is included in the room etc
- Booking details
- Billing and Payment
- Record keeping guest records, guests and allocated rooms, vacancy of rooms, room services
- Database CSV document for customer/guest's details
- Test table to show that the system fully works as intended
